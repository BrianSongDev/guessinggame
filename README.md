# The Guessing Game v0.0.2
A minimalistic, cumulative web game for the willing! Made with ReactJS.
![](/public/readmescreen.png)
### Features
- This game allows you to, using the lowest amount of tries possible, guess a number from 1 to a number of your choice (inclusive)! It alerts you whether your guess is too low or too high, and how many guesses you have taken to guess the number. It also records your lowest guess count and motivates you to achieve lower than that.
- Clean, modern UI with essential objects for optimal play
- NEW Move Analyzer gives you some hints on how you are doing so far, and gives you a bit of help to get the randomly generated number.
### Installation and Playtime
- Clone the project into your preferred folder.
- Using terminal or powershell, CD into the folder.
- For development builds (not serious), do ```npm start``` (make sure npm is INSTALLED). Go to localhost:3000 to access and have fun!
- For production builds (serious), do ```npm run build``` and go to the address your terminal gives you. Have fun!
### Collaborators
If you would like to help me in endeavoring this project, you should take a look at the code and experiment yourself using "git clone." This is using the basic React framework, so it should be pretty easy to navigate between files (as there are only so many). If you REALLY want to help with the project, you can check out the to-do list below and see what issues you can work on. Email brians3476@gmail.com upon successful implementation. Thanks!
### Bugs
After looking at the code, if you see an inconsistency or you see something that does not make sense when you run the code, please post your problem in issues. (https://github.com/BrianSongDev/guessinggame/issues)   
Any valid error is extremely appreciated!
